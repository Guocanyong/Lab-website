description: <p align="left"><font size="5" >The glucagon receptor (GCGR) and  glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) are  two members of the class B family of G protein-  coupled receptors (GPCRs). Their endogenous  ligands are both hormone polypeptides, i.e.,  glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1),  respectively. These two types of hormone  polypeptide exert their physiological functions  by binding to the receptors. The interaction  between these polypeptides and their receptors  at the orthosteric sites of transmembrane  domains (TMDs) plays important roles in their  signaling pathway. Here we applied the method  of fluorine NMR paramagnetic relaxation  enhancement to study the direct interaction  between these two polypeptides and the TMDs  of their respective receptors in solution.  Fluorine atoms were introduced into various  sequence positions of the TMDs, using In Membrane Chemical Modification (IMCM)  of cysteine residues. Paramagnetic nitroxide  spin labels were attached to engineered cysteine  residues in the polypeptides. For each of the two receptor systems, 19F-NMR  signals from locations near the orthosteric  binding site were significantly broadened by  nitroxyl free radical-labeled polypeptides, while  signals on the intracellular surface were not  affected, which suggests that each of the two  polypeptides specifically interacts with the  extracellular surface of the its receptorâ€™s TMD.<font><p>
