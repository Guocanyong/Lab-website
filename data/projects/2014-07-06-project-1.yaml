description: <p align="left"><font size="5" >Neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), also named as  tachykinin 1 receptor (TACR1), is activated by  the endogenous ligand substance P (SP), the  first   mammalian  neuropeptide  identified  in 1931 by Von Euler and Gaddum. NK1R is  widely distributed in the central and peripheral  nervous system and is critically associated with inflammatory and immune responses, neurodegenerative disease, cancer and emesis. Aprepitant belongs to a class of drugs called substance  P  antagonists,  which  mediate their effect by blocking the NK1R. Aprepitant  contains 7 intrinsic fluorine atoms. To explore  binding  of aprepitant with  NK1R in  solution, we acquired 19F NMR spectra of the complexes. The ligand aprepitant showed two fluorine  peaks at -62.6 ppm and -113.1 ppm in  DDM/CHS buffer, which are assigned to the  two trifluoromethyl groups and the single 19F  atom on the aromatic ring, respectively. Upon  binding to NK1R with N782.50, the peak M in spectrum was present with only low intensity, and two new peaks P1 (-61.6 ppm)  and P2 (-63.0 ppm) correspond to the two trifluoromethyl groups experiencing different binding environments. Endogenous  peptide SP displaced aprepitant from NK1R, indicating that aprepitant occupies a similar binding pocket as the endogenous ligand SP.<font><p>
