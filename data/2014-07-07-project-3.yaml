description: <p align="left"><font size="5" >Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is the principal  target of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a  psychoactive chemical from Cannabis sativa  with a wide range of therapeutic applications  and a long history of recreational use. Both  antagonist- and agonist-bound crystal structures  of human CB1R have been reported. While the  crystal structures describe the molecular  architecture in great detail and identify  structural differences between activated and  inactive forms of CB1R, 19F-NMR provided  additional information on local conformational  polymorphisms and the rate of associated  conformational exchange processes. Chemical fluorine labeling of GPCRs requires  cysteine residues near the cytoplasmic surface  which are accessible for chemical reagents.  Generally, cysteine residues have to be  engineered into informative sequence positions  in GPCRs, which then also requires special care  to ascertain that such modifications preserve the biological activity. Here, we used an efficient method for incorporating the non-protein genic amino acid trimethylfluoro-phenylalanine (tfmF) into CB1R by expanding the genetic  code for expression in insect cells. 19F–NMR  spectra of CB1R in complexes with various  ligands  show  that  the  cytoplasmic  end of helices VI and VII adopt two major conformational states in equilibrium, which is  reminiscent of earlier observations in the β2-  adrenergic receptor (β2AR). Exploring biased  agonist signaling involving helices VI and VII  of CB1R is ongoing.<font><p>
